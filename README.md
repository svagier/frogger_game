# frogger_game
This is a 'Frogger' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) based game, written for the purpose of Machine Learning task for my studies (Artifical Intelligence course). What's more, I wrote this game to practice Python as well and to get familiar with pygame library.

The game is very simple - the player can move in four directions (arrow keys) to steer the frog. The aim of the game is to reach the goals at the top (the lane with flags at the top). The frog dies (loses) when hit by trucks, which are moving randomly, with constant speed, on the lanes below the goals. There are also immovable obstacles (traffic cones).

DQN agent was later applied to play the game with help of Tensorflow library - however, this short code is not included in this repository.
